# Meraki notifier to Webex Teams

This webhook listens to Meraki scanning notifications, and posts messages to a Webex Teams space as known devices are seen/leaving the Meraki SSID.

To run this code, you will need to:
1. a Meraki Access Point
2. create a scanning Webhook pointing to this code (exposed at a public URL / ngrok)
3. create a Teams Space and a Bot token
4. update the list of known Mac addresses in [people.js](./people.js)
5. launch the app with specified env variables (see below)

All set! please reach to your space and wait for notifications to fly in as devices connect

## Quick start on Glitch

Click [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/ObjectIsAdvantag/meraki-notifier)

Then open the `.env` file and paste the Webex Teams info: bot's token and space id
You app is now running (with default Meraki settings).
Your app healthcheck is accessible at your webhook public url.

Open the Meraki dashboard, and create a scanning webhook pointing to your webhook URL on glitch.
Tip: add `/scanning` to the glitch public URL

Now, update the Meraki entry in `.env` with your meraki SSID, secret and validator.
And update the list of known Mac addresses in `./people.js`

All set! Connect your device it for notifications to fly in as devices connect
